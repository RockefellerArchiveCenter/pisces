For instance, the correspondence files tend to be in reverse chronological order, whereas more general files are in alphabetical order by subject, which is usually typed on the right side of the document. His arrangement within folders, however, is not always consistent. The Office Memorandum folders, for instance, combine order by memorandum number within a rough overall alphabetical order.

This research focused on the synthetic, analytical, and inorganic problems in chemical warfare and B\u20134 toxicity, especially mustard gases. This series consists primarily of correspondence, receipts, and forms tracking the routine exchange and use of scientific reports. Correspondence with other scientists also documents the exchange of samples, as well as directions for specific tests, preparations of samples, and brief discussions of reactions and test results. Also included is a significant amount of correspondence and forms related to the Espionage Act Oaths of Secrecy and Selective Service deferments for the scientists working in Bergmann's laboratory. The Literature files consist of reports and reprints from other scientists, along with Bergmann's handwritten notes about what he read. Also included in this series is an incomplete set of Administrative Circulars and Office Memorandum documenting the policies and procedures of the Office of Scientific Research and Development and the National Defense Research Committee. The majority of memos are located in Box 5, but some are filed alphabetically by subject throughout the series.\n\nEight folders in this series have a correlating folder with the same title in series 5: Declassified Reports, the contents of which were declassified by the U.S. Army after this collection was archivally processed. Researchers may wish to review both the folder in this series as well as the one with the same title found in series 5 for a full view of material on a given subject.",

After receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Berlin in 1911, he worked closely as an assistant to Hermann Emil Fischer from 1911 to 1919. Together, they laid the foundation for scientific knowledge of proteins, carbohydrates, and tannins. Following the suicide of Fischer, Bergmann accepted a position as Vice\u2013Director and Head of the Department of Organic Chemistry at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Fiber Chemistry in Berlin. In 1921, he moved on to serve as Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Leather Research until 1933. When the conditions in Germany grew too hostile, he emigrated to the United States and became an Associate Member of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research where he continued as a pioneer of applied sciences focused on proteins and protein\u2013splitting enzymes, as well as the chemistry of carbohydrates and fats. In 1937, he became a full member of the Institute. He died at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York on November 7, 1944. At the time of his death, he was working under contract with the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development to benefit the national defense during World War II. This research focused on the synthetic, analytical, and inorganic problems in chemical warfare and B\u20134 toxicity, especially mustard gases.",

The records are particularly focused on the research he conducted in the 1940s on problems of interest to the U.S. Armed Forces, namely the synthetic, analytical, and inorganic problems in chemical warfare and B\u20134 toxicity, especially mustard gases. Records consist mostly of laboratory research notes, notes on related scientific literature, research progress reports, correspondence with colleagues and administrative officials, administrative circulars and memoranda, reprints of Bergmann publications, and receipts of classified reports and scientific samples. Research topics of interest include World War II chemical warfare research, Selective Service deferments for scientists, policies and procedures of the Office of Scientific Research and Development and the National Defense Research Committee, and the \"brain drain\" or significant emigration of scientists and technologists to the United States from Europe as a result of hostile conditions prior to World War II. The collection also contains a minimal amount of biographical material, including Bergmann's personal correspondence, documents relating to Bergmann's funeral, and photographs.",
