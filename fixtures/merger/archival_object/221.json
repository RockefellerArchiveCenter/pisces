This research focused on the synthetic, analytical, and inorganic problems in chemical warfare and B\u20134 toxicity, especially mustard gases. Records consist primarily of informal and formal progress reports, as well as the laboratory and literature notes of two of Bergmann's key scientific staff members, William H. Stein and Stanford Moore.\n\nEight folders in this series have a correlating folder with the same title in series 5: Declassified Reports, the contents of which were declassified by the U.S. Army after this collection was archivally processed. Researchers may wish to review both the folder in this series as well as the one with the same title found in series 5 for a full view of material on a given subject.",

After receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Berlin in 1911, he worked closely as an assistant to Hermann Emil Fischer from 1911 to 1919. Together, they laid the foundation for scientific knowledge of proteins, carbohydrates, and tannins. Following the suicide of Fischer, Bergmann accepted a position as Vice\u2013Director and Head of the Department of Organic Chemistry at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Fiber Chemistry in Berlin. In 1921, he moved on to serve as Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Leather Research until 1933. When the conditions in Germany grew too hostile, he emigrated to the United States and became an Associate Member of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research where he continued as a pioneer of applied sciences focused on proteins and protein\u2013splitting enzymes, as well as the chemistry of carbohydrates and fats. In 1937, he became a full member of the Institute. He died at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York on November 7, 1944. At the time of his death, he was working under contract with the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development to benefit the national defense during World War II. This research focused on the synthetic, analytical, and inorganic problems in chemical warfare and B\u20134 toxicity, especially mustard gases.",

Records consist mostly of laboratory research notes, notes on related scientific literature, research progress reports, correspondence with colleagues and administrative officials, administrative circulars and memoranda, reprints of Bergmann publications, and receipts of classified reports and scientific samples. Research topics of interest include World War II chemical warfare research, Selective Service deferments for scientists, policies and procedures of the Office of Scientific Research and Development and the National Defense Research Committee, and the \"brain drain\" or significant emigration of scientists and technologists to the United States from Europe as a result of hostile conditions prior to World War II.
