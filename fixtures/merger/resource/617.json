The first investigation was headed by Edward Eugene Cox (R-Georgia) and the second by B. Carroll Reece (R-Tennessee).\n\nThe Cox investigation involved subpoenaed responses to a lengthy questionnaire, followed by hearings, at which Dean Rusk, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, testified for the Foundation and the General Education Board, which was inactive, but which maintained a corporate existence whose affairs were administered by the Foundation.\n\nThe Reece investigation also involved responses to written questions, but hearings were not held. In the course of the investigations, the political orientation of various organizations was scrutinized, including the Rockefeller Foundation and the GEB, in part by focusing on the political orientation of grant and fellowship recipients, both individuals and institutions.\n\n", "publish": true}], "publish": true}, {"jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "ba77785fdd7e3dfa4a4e702708597ab9", "label": "Biographical/Historical note", "type": "bioghist", "subnotes": [{"jsonmodel_type": "note_text", "content": "Edward Eugene Cox\n\nRepresentative from Georgia; born near Camilla, Mitchell County, Ga., April 3, 1880; attended the grade schools, Camilla High School, the academic department of Mercer University, Macon, Ga., for nearly four years, and was graduated from the law department of that university in 1902; was admitted to the bar the same year and commenced practice at Camilla, Ga.; mayor of Camilla 1904-1906; delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1908; appointed and subsequently elected judge of the superior court of the Albany circuit and served from 1912 until he resigned in 1916, having become a candidate for Congress; unsuccessful candidate for election in 1916 to the Sixty-fifth Congress; elected as a Democrat to the Sixty-ninth and to the thirteen succeeding Congresses and served from March 4, 1925, until his death; chairman, Select Committee on Tax Exempt Foundations (Eighty-second Congress); had been reelected to the Eighty-third Congress; died in Bethesda, Md., December 24, 1952; interment in Oakview Cemetery, Camilla, Ga.1.\n\n<extref href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/mem_bio/index.html\">http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/mem_bio/index.html</extref>\n", "publish": true}], "publish": true}, {"jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "ef72334dcfc5265a4c714fd753fafe01", "label": "Biographical/Historical note", "type": "bioghist", "subnotes": [{"jsonmodel_type": "note_text", "content": "B.
