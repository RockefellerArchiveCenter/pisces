A Division of Studies was created in 1923 to handle projects outside the medical field.  These early years were experimental as the new foundation studied the methods of philanthropy and explored its relationships with other Rockefeller boards.\n\nAlthough the Rockefeller Foundation is the largest and best known philanthropy founded by the Rockefeller family, it was neither the first nor the last to be established.  The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (1901), the General Education Board (1902), the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease (1909), and the Bureau of Social Hygiene (1911) all existed earlier.  When the Foundation was created, the Sanitary Commission was disbanded.  After the establishment of the Foundation, the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial (1918) and the International Education Board (1923) were created.\n\nThe Rockefeller boards and their programs were reconsidered and reorganized in 1927-1928 in order to avoid overlapping programs.  The International Health Board of the Foundation was disbanded and an International Health Division was organized.  The China Medical Board, Inc., was established as a separately incorporated institution, and the China Medical Board of the Foundation ceased to exist.  The Division of Studies was dropped and the Division of Medical Education was phased out.  The Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial was combined with the Foundation and the Spelman Fund of New York was chartered to continue activities of the LSRM that were not absorbed by the Foundation.  The International Education Board was disbanded.\n\nAs a result of this reorganization, the Foundation adopted a program which included public health work (administered by the IHD), the advancement of knowledge in the medical and natural sciences (in part taken over from the IEB), the social sciences (formerly the field of the LSRM), and the humanities and arts (shared with the GEB).  The Rockefeller Institute and the Bureau of Social Hygiene were not affected by the reorganization.  The program adopted by the Foundation at this time remained basically the same for the next twenty years.\n\nAs its files accumulated, the Foundation maintained a card index recording the names of institutional and individual grantees and correspondents.
