There are 10 reports from the New York Republican State Dinner Committee and 19 reports from the Governor's Club. These are file copies of reports sent to the Secretary of State by James G. Hellmuth, who served as treasurer for both organizations. All but three reports have cover letters from Hellmuth. Attached to the cover letter of most of the reports are certified mail receipts and return receipts from mailing the original reports.\n\nThe reports consist of Schedule A--receipts--and Schedule B--disbursements. Schedule A is an itemized list of contributions which include the name and address of each contributor and the date and amount of the contribution. Contributions are listed in the order in which they were received, thus finding a particular name is time consuming. Schedule B is a short list of expenses and contributions. With three exceptions all the contributions from both organizations were to the New York Republican State Committee. However, the Dinner Committee made contributions to the New York Republican County Committee in 1968, to the United Service Organization in 1969, and to the Friends of the Rockefeller Team in 1971. The Governor's Club maintained a running balance from year to year, while the Dinner Committee contributed the entire balance, after expenses, at the end of each year.\n\nOther than a covering letter these reports contain no correspondence, charter, or promotional literature or any other evidence of the nature of these organizations or who ran them. Since the reason for each expense is summarized in one or two words, Schedule B offers scant clues about the types of premiums offered in return for a contribution.\n\nThe size of the individual contributions was evidently in response to appeals for certain amounts. The contributions listed in the 1968 report for the Governor's Club, for example, are either for $100 or $500, mostly the latter. Members of the Rockefeller family are found among the contributors in each of these reports. Rockefellers contributing to the Governor's Club include NAR's brothers--John D. 3rd, Laurance S., Winthrop, and David Rockefeller--and his sons Rodman and Steven. Their contributions are in the $100 to $500 range like all the others. An exception is in 1973 when David and Laurance each contributed $5,000 in additional to their usual $500 contribution. Regular Rockefeller contributors to the Dinner Committee include NAR, John 3rd, Laurance, David and Martha Baird Rockefeller, NAR's stepmother. NAR's sister, Abby Rockefeller Mauze, contributed in 1970 and 1971. The size of these contributions is at the high end of the scale; $1,500 each in 1967 and 1968, $3,000 each in the years following. An exception is 1970, the year of NAR's costliest gubernatorial campaign, when four family members made contributions of $6,000 each. The most common amount from other contributors to the Dinner Committee was $150. NAR's former wife, Mary C. Rockefeller, made a $500 contribution in 1967.\n\nThe volume numbers were added when the material was processed in 1999.", "publish": true}], "publish": true}, {"jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "66a46aa9040dc54f0c8d8693e72caab3", "label": "Processing Information note", "type": "processinfo", "subnotes": [{"jsonmodel_type": "note_text", "content": "Harold W.
