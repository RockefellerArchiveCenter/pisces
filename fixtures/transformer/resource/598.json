The program included breeding of adapted varieties of both spring and winter wheat for various ecological conditions, training for wheat scientists from cooperating countries, and advice and assistance in the development of the local research and production programs. In September 1967 the Rockefeller and Turkey began negotiations for the Rockefeller Foundation to participate in the development of the national wheat program. By July 1, 1970, the Turkish Wheat Research and Training Center had been established. The Rockefeller Foundation agreed to a start-up grant of $100,000, which was to expire at the end of 1968. Rockefeller Foundation funding was extended and renewed through the 1970s. In 1977 the Rockefeller Foundation signed a final three-year extension.\n\nQuality was not considered important at the start of the project. Rather, the point was to produce a large amount of wheat. The project pioneered an approach to the problem of a specific crop.\n\nThere were several issues with the Wheat Research Project that quickly became apparent. Initially, only fluent English speakers were eligible for overseas training. As the program developed, staff received English language instruction before going for training, but once abroad they required additional training in order to function effectively and produce. Relations with the Turkish government were also complicated, and issues arose with organization and method. There were also struggles with various governmental departments. These issues were not helped by Turkey's bureaucracy and climate of administrative instability, attributable to constantly changing governments.\n\nOver thirteen years Turkish wheat production increased from around 10 million metric tons to 17 million with general agreement that this increase was largely owing to the wheat improvement project.\n\nVarious names were used to refer to the Wheat Research and Training Program, including: Middle East Wheat Improvement Project, Wheat Improvement Project, Wheat Research Program, Mid-East Wheat Research and Training Center, and Ankara Field Office.\n\nSignificant staff members include: Ahmet Demirlicakmak, Charles K. Mann, E. E. Saari, Jon Michael Prescott, and Bill C. Wright.",
