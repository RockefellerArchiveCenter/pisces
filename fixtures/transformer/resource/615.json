Created in collaboration with the Servico Especiales de Saude Publica (Special Service of Public Health), the Belem virus laboratory sought to classify these viruses and examine the way they presented in humans and domesticated animals.\n\nOttis R. Causey  was the first director of the virus laboratory. He and his wife, Calista Eliot Causey, established the laboratory in 1954, and Causey remained director until 1963. Causey received his Doctor of Science degree  in entomology, parasitology, and bacteriology from Johns Hopkins University. During his career with the Rockefeller Foundation, Causey devoted himself to the field of arbovirology. Under his tenure, the lab isolated about 1,600 viruses, of which 50 were found to be distinct viruses.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the Rockefeller Foundation began to phase out its virus research program. The New York laboratory  was incorporated into the Yale School of Medicine in 1964, becoming the Yale Arbovirus Research Unit,  and several of the foundation's field laboratories integrated with universities or government research agencies. Robert E. Shope, M.D., directed the Belem laboratory  from 1963 through June 1965, and was succeeded by John P. Woodall, who served until the field office's closing in 1971. \n\nIn the course of its existence, the Belem Virus Laboratory was responsible for isolating many viruses. Seeking to determine which viruses were present in their specific region, researchers studied blood samples from monkeys, mice, and humans. This isolation of viruses gave information about the prevalence of certain viruses and the conditions under which they were likely to occur. The laboratory established different methods for rapidly classifying viruses and new ways for monitoring the effects of the viruses on humans and animals. The laboratory made significant contributions to the knowledge of virus activity and lifecycles.",
