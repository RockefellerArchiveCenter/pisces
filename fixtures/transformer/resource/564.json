Molitor, Jerry Danzig, George Hinman, Ilene Slater, and Alexander Halpern. They document the official activities of these individuals in the execution of their duties as members of Nelson A. Rockefeller's gubernatorial and/or political campaign staffs. The actions, decisions and exchanges of information or points of view documented here occurred in the course of proposing and implementing policies for the Rockefeller administration and/or political campaigns. However, unless a document is specifically addressed to or from Nelson A. Rockefeller, or is referred to in a document addressed to him, it should not be assumed that he saw the document or was aware of its existence or substance. Furthermore, researchers should bear in mind that staff files may contain documents addressed to Rockefeller that were never shown to him.\n\nSCOPE AND CONTENT\n\nPrior to his election as Governor of New York in November 1958, Nelson A. Rockefeller maintained an office at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan. To separate his work as Governor from his private activities, Governor Rockefeller established an office in Manhattan at 22 West 55th Street. This became known as the New York Office, to distinguish it from the Governor's office in the state capitol building in Albany. Governor Rockefeller was the first governor to maintain a permanent office in New York City. In general, Governor Rockefeller was in Albany only when the state legislature was in session or on special occasion. The management of his public duties was largely undertaken from the New York Office.\n\nThis series primarily documents Rockefeller's travel and public appearances during his first two terms as governor, portions of his 1962 gubernatorial reelection campaign, and portions of his campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination in 1960 and 1964.",
