Her next job was as a personal secretary to Adele Rosenwald Levy, whose father, Julius Rosenwald, was a founder of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Whitman worked for the Committee for a Free Europe. She was recruited to work for the Eisenhower presidential campaign in 1952, going on to work for Eisenhower as his personal secretary through his eight years in the White House and then for a short time at President Eisenhower's retirement home at Gettysburg.\n\nIn 1961, Whitman went to work for George Hinman, a political advisor to Governor Nelson Rockefeller. In 1965 she became Rockefeller's executive assistant. She went on to serve as Rockefeller's chief of staff during the first six months of his Vice Presidential tenure. In June 1975, Whitman returned to New York, assisting Rockefeller until her retirement in 1977.",

The actions, decisions, and exchanges of information or points of view documented here occured in the course of proposing and implementing policies for the Rockefeller administration, political campaigns, and/or Rockefeller's personal activities. However, unless a document is personally signed by Nelson A. Rockefeller, or is referred to in a document personally signed by him, it should not be assumed he saw the document or was aware of its existence or substance. Furthermore, researchers should bear in mind that staff files may contain documents or drafts addressed to Rockefeller that were never shown to him.\n\nSCOPE AND CONTENT\n\nIn her role as Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller's executive assistant, Ann Whitman maintained a large number of his office files. This series primarily covers the time period surrounding the 1968 Presidential election, when Governor Rockefeller sought the Republican party's presidential nomination. A significant portion of the material deals with the deepening conflict in Vietnam.",
