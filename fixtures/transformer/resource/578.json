These files document official activities in the execution of her duties as a member of Rockefeller's staff. Unless a document is specifically addressed to or from Nelson A. Rockefeller, or is referred to in a document addressed to him, it should not be assumed he saw the document or was aware of its existence or substance. Furthermore, researchers should bear in mind that staff files may contain documents or drafts addressed to Rockefeller that were never shown to him.\n\nSCOPE AND CONTENT\n\nThe National Commission on Water Quality (NCWQ) was formed in1972 by President Richard Nixon, who appointed Nelson A. Rockefeller (then-governor of New York) chair of the Commission. It was an outgrowth of the 1972 Water Pollution Control Act. The Commission got off to a late start: The first meeting was in May 1973. It did not meet its reporting deadline of October 1975 but continued into 1976. The Commission consisted of five members from the public sector and ten from Congress--five each from both chambers. Senator Edmund Muskie and Senator Robert Jones co-chaired the Commission. (Throughout the collection, there is evidence of in-fighting between Rockefeller and Muskie.) The staff of 60 was headed by General Frederick Clarke.\n\nThe papers in this collection are those of Donna R. Mitchell. Mitchell, who had been Deputy Director of Rockefeller's Washington office while he was governor of New York, was appointed assistant to the chairman of the NCWQ. She was the key point person between the commission and the staff. She was also Rockefeller's confidential source of information about all aspects of the project as indicated in various memos. (Boxes 21, 22, and 23 contain Mitchell's own reports on New York State Federal Legislation to the Executive Chamber and Albany State Agencies from 1959 to 1967.)\n\nMost significantly, this series consists of hundreds of studies done under contract with outside organizations. The commission spent $11.6 million of its $15 million budget on contracts. The reports cover five broad areas: Technology and Cost Studies (Boxes 31-37); Economic, Social, and Benefit Studies (Boxes 38-42); Environmental Studies (Boxes 42-46); Institutional Studies (Boxes 46-48); and Regional Studies (Boxes 48-53). The material incorporates legal studies of the all-important Public Law 92-500 (the 1972 Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act). As well, the series contains hundreds of newspaper and magazine clippings covering pollution, industry, treatment centers, water quality, and the politics of the NCWQ.\n\nAdditionally, these papers contain Nelson Rockefeller's correspondence with governors, cities, industries, and environmentalists. Boxes 26 and 27 contain Rockefeller's chronological correspondence from 1973 to 1976.\n\nThe series also documents the development of the staff's substantial report to the commission (Boxes 14-16, with the final copy in Box 55). The report went through three drafts and then underwent hearings in five major U.S. cities, with Rockefeller presiding over the hearings in Washington, DC (Boxes 17-18). A surprising lacuna of the collection is documentation of the drafting and discussion of the Commission's final report to Congress, which does not appear.",
