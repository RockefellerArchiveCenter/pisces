A Division of Studies was created in 1923 to handle projects outside the medical field. These early years were experimental as the new foundation studied the methods of philanthropy and explored its relationships with other Rockefeller boards.\n\nAlthough the Rockefeller Foundation is the largest and best known philanthropy founded by the Rockefeller family, it was neither the first nor the last to be established. The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (1901), the General Education Board (1902), the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease (1909), and the Bureau of Social Hygiene (1911) all existed earlier. When the Foundation was created, the Sanitary Commission was disbanded. After the establishment of the Foundation, the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial (1918) and the International Education Board (1923) were created.\n\nThe Rockefeller boards and their programs were reconsidered and reorganized in 1927-1928 in order to avoid overlapping programs. The International Health Board of the Foundation was disbanded and an International Health Division was organized. The China Medical Board, Inc., was established as a separately incorporated institution, and the China Medical Board of the Foundation ceased to exist. The Division of Studies was dropped and the Division of Medical Education was phased out. The Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial was combined with the Foundation and the Spelman Fund of New York was chartered to continue activities of the LSRM that were not absorbed by the Foundation. The International Education Board was disbanded.\n\nAs a result of this reorganization, the Foundation adopted a program which included public health work (administered by the IHD), the advancement of knowledge in the medical and natural sciences (in part taken over from the IEB), the social sciences (formerly the field of the LSRM), and the humanities and arts (shared with the GEB). The Rockefeller Institute and the Bureau of Social Hygiene were not affected by the reorganization. The program adopted by the Foundation at this time remained basically the same for the next twenty years.\n\nAs its files accumulated, the Foundation maintained a card index recording the names of institutional and individual grantees and correspondents. A microfilm copy of this index is available at the Archive Center.\n\n",

                    "content": "The International Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation maintained an office in Paris from 1917 as the headquarters for the work of the Commission for the Prevention of Tuberculosis in France. In 1922, anticipating the transfer of the tuberculosis work to the French, and the expansion of work in Europe, the Board agreed to share space and administrative expenses with the Rockefeller Foundation's Division of Medical Education. The Nursing Survey of the IHB was to be carried on from the same location. Other administrative units of the Foundation concerned with work in Europe used the same office.\n\nThe Paris office can be described as a colony of more or less independent units, occupying the same office space, loosely bound together under a chairman and a committee, both advisory in function, and sharing common services. The chairman of the Paris office exercised a general oversight, acting as advisor and coordinator. He was the representative of the President in Paris in the sense that he transmitted all general instruction from the central executives to the group while in the other direction he was spokesman for the group to New York. He had full Power of Attorney for all Rockefeller Foundation property in France. All bank accounts were in his name. He called together and presided over the Paris officers in committees for discussions of mutual problems and in consultation with them either agreed to or rejected their various fellowships and grants-in-aid dockets, his signature being required, as well as that of the Comptroller and divisional representative concerned, on all Paris office grants. Chairmen of the Paris office before World War II were Selskar M. Gunn, 1922-1932; George K. Strode, 1932-1938; A. J. Warren, 1938-1939; and Selskar M. Gunn, 1939-1940.\n\nThe office committee, which corresponded roughly to the staff conference in New York, had no legal status whatever yet acquired with the years a definite function. All officers' actions or grants-in-aid, grants for deposed scholars, and fellowships passed through this committee. Here, questions of general policy were discussed.\n\nOfficers in divisions in Paris had an integrity and autonomy unknown in New York, that granted by sheer remoteness from the main office. From fund allocated by directors in New York for expenditure in Europe, officers had the power of independent action without reference to New York, limited however to grants-in-aid and fellowships of not more than one year and $3,000.\n\nThe Paris office was the fiscal agent of the New York office with respect to European affairs. The Paris office administered payments under appropriations made by the Trustees in New York for European projects. The Comptroller also administered payments under officers actions in Paris, and acted as fiscal agent for the General Education Board and for the national councils with respect to fellows assigned to Europe for study.\n\nThe Administrator of the Paris office was charged with the non-divisional functions of the office, i.e., personnel, office quarters, equipment, central services, travel, purchasing, etc. The budget was made up in two sections, the principal part in francs, the lesser in dollars.\n\nDivisions represented at the Paris office before World War II were the International Health Board, later the International Health Division, the Division of Studies, the Division of Medical Education, the Medical Sciences Division, the Divisions of Natural and social Sciences. Officers assigned to the Paris office included F. Elisabeth Crowell, E. E. Day, Alan Gregg, Selskar M. Gunn, Lauder Jones, Tracey B. Kittredge, Robert A. Lambert, H. M. Miller, Daniel P. O'Brien, Richard M. Pearce, F. F. Russell, George K. Strode, Wilbur E. Tisdale, John Van Sickle, George E. Vincent, A. J. Warren, and Warren Weaver.\n\nIn 1941, the Paris office closed for the duration of the war. The space was used for a time by an agency of the Vichy Government under the direction of Dr. Alexis Carrell, and the Foundation's work in Europe was continued by the newly formed Rockefeller Foundation Health Commission. One staff member, the Comptroller, Robert Letort, a native Frenchman, remained on the payroll looking after the Foundation's interests. In 1945 Letort and Charles N. Leach, a member of the RHC, reopened the office. It remained open until 1959, but its functions and character were completely changed. It became a place maintained for the convenience of a small group of officers assigned more or less permanently to Paris and for the convenience also of the somewhat larger group who used Paris as a base for European travel. It still had a chairman with whom the New York office, usually through the vice president, corresponded on questions of general policy. Only two divisions, Medical Sciences and International Health Division, maintained permanent staff. The Paris office postwar had no funds for allocation of grants-in-aid and fellowships. These were administered from New York. Except for payments to French projects, all appropriations to European projects were now paid from New York. The Staff maintained services such as filing and bookkeeping and provided secretarial service. Personnel assigned to the Paris office in the postwar period included Johannes H. Bauer, Elizabeth W. Brackett, Robert P. Burden, John B. Grant, Frederic C. Lane, Charles N. Leach, John Maier, H. M. Miller, Daniel P. O'Brien, Paul Russell, R. Rolf Struthers, Mary E. Tennant. Chairmen of the Paris office were Rolf Struthers, 1946-1954, and John Maier, 1954-1959.",
