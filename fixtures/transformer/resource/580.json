The actions, decisions, and exchanges of information or points of view documented here occurred in the course of proposing and implementing policies for the Rockefeller administration, political campaigns, and/or Rockefeller's personal activities. However, unless a document is specifically addressed to or from Nelson Rockefeller, or is referred to in a document addressed to him, it should not be assumed he saw the document or was aware of its existence or substance. Furthermore, researchers should bear in mind that staff files may contain documents or drafts addressed to Rockefeller that were never shown to him.\n\nSCOPE AND CONTENT\n\nThis series focuses on Joseph E. Persico's service as the chief speech writer for Nelson A. Rockefeller during his two last terms as Governor of New York (1967-1973) and during his service as Vice President of the United States (1974-1977). This collection contains the speeches and press releases that Persico wrote in this capacity. His personal papers and writings are at the New York State Archives in Albany.\n\nMost of this series is made up of speech files. They contain one or more different versions of each speech: drafts, reading copies, transcripts, or press releases. Drafts and reading copies are likely to include Governor Rockefeller's handwritten changes and notations. Some files contain memos, schedules, or background information on the event at which the speech was given.",

He graduated from the State University of New York at Albany in 1952 with a B.A. in both English and political science. He then served in the U.S. Navy for three years as a Lt. Junior Grade aboard a minesweeper and at NATO headquarters in Naples, Italy. Returning to the United States in 1954, he matriculated at Columbia University for his graduate work. He received a Ph.D. from the State University of New York at Albany in 1966.\n\nHe began his writing career in 1956, serving New York Governor Averill Harriman. In 1959, he became a Foreign Service Officer for the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) in Brazil, Argentina, and Washington, DC. Between 1963 and 1966, he served as executive assistant to New York Health Commissioner Hollis Ingraham.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1974, Persico was Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller's chief speech writer and remained in that position during Rockefeller's vice presidency.\n\nPersico's first book, published in 1977, was \"My Enemy, My Brother,\" a history of the Battle of Gettysburg. In 1982, Persico published a biography of Nelson Rockefeller, \"The Imperial Rockefeller.\" More recently, Persico collaborated with Colin Powell on his biography and wrote a book on Franklin Roosevelt, \"Roosevelt's Secret War: FDR and World War II Espionage.\"",
