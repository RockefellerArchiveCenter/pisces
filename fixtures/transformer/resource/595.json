                    "content": "From 1935 to 1973, the New Delhi Field Office of the Rockefeller Foundation (RF) administered cooperative programs throughout India in the fields of medicine and public health (1935-1973), agriculture (1956-73), and the humanities and social sciences (1964-72). The New Delhi office also served as the RF's Far Eastern regional headquarters, replacing Shanghai temporarily from 1942 to 1946 and permanently after 1949. Between 1949 and 1952, the office was located in Bangalore.\n\nThe New Delhi office was headed by the Field Director or Foundation Representative in India, who served as a scientist-cum-administrator and reported to the appropriate division director in New York. His staff included an Assistant Field Director, staff scientists and research assistants, and local administrative personnel. The field office staff was continually augmented by visiting specialists from around the world. By 1966, the fifteen-member staff in New Delhi constituted the largest RF contingent outside New York.\n\nThe RF's International Health Division (IHD) had established the first office in New Delhi for the purpose of extending its India hookworm control program, which had begun in the Madras Presidency in 1920. Subsequent medical and public health activities in India included malaria control, the development of demonstration health units, nursing education, nutrition studies, and, increasingly throughout the 1950s and 1960s, medical education and research. Significant grants went to the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health in Calcutta (1913-50) and the Virus Research Center at Poona (1951-71). Grants also supported the Indian Council for Medical Research and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (1952-1973).\n\nThe last year in which grants were made in the medical field from the New Delhi office was 1970. At that time, the RF's Medical and Natural Sciences division separated into two distinct disciplines, Biomedical Sciences and Natural and Environmental Sciences.\n\nThe RF's agricultural work in India officialy began in 1956 when the Government of India and the RF signed a Memorandum of Understanding. This agreement created the Indian Agricultural Program (IAP) and spread the so-called Green Revolution to India. The IAP was the fourth in a series of ambitious \"country\" programs in agriculture begun by the RF in Mexico (1943) and subsequently extended to Colombia (1950) and Chile (1955). Its purpose was twofold: to increase cereal crop production through the development of high-yielding seed, and to strengthen graduate education in agriculture. Under the Memorandum of Understanding, the Government of India arranged for the necessary land and facilities and budget for local staff, while the RF provided a permanent staff of resident specialists and appropriated annual sums for equipment and other expenses incurred by the field programs. The Foundation also made grants to selected agricultural institutions and to Indian scientists to pursue research in the United States.\n\nResearch and postgraduate training were viewed as interrelated activities. In 1958, with the Foundation's support, a postgraduate school was inaugurated at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi (est. 1905), with the authority to award the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees. After 1960, new legislation made possible the creation of several state agricultural universities modeled after American land-grant universities. These universities developed relationships with the various crop improvement programs and offered valuable research opportunities for American and Indian agronomists.\n\nThe All India Coordinated Cereal Improvement Projects, the backbone of the IAP research program, represented a new approach to crop research in India. Sponsored by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and jointly operated by the ICAR and state institutions, each project studies the agronomy, entomology, pathology, genetics, and breeding of an individual crop. For the first time, research stations and substations were established throughout the subcontinent in order to coordinate research activities across the major agro-climatic zones. The programs began with maize in 1957 (although maize work had begun in India in 1945) and came to include sorghum and other millets (1957), wheat (1961), and rice (1965). Notable increases occurred in wheat production with the importation in 1965 of dwarf materials from Mexico. In conducting seed development research, the IAP benefited from the expertise of those RF agronomists who had served first in Mexico, namely Edwin J. Wellhausen, Ulysses J. Grant, Ernest W. Sprague, and the 1970 Nobel Prize winner, Norman E. Borlaug. Allied areas of research included drainage, fertility, soil and water management, and agricultural economics.\n\nIn 1973, the RF decided to bring to a close its Indian Agricultural Program. India continued to carry out crop improvement work, utilizing the administrative, teaching, and research structures jointly established over seventeen years by the IAP and the Government of India. The RF therefore phased out its involvement in all improvement programs except rice, which was continued until 1975 by Wayne H. Freeman at Hyderabad. From 1976 to 1983, the Hyderabad office under Leland R. House operated the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). This institute functioned as part of the Foundation's \"Conquest of Hunger\" program, which had been formally established in 1963.\n\nIn October 1964, Chadbourne Gilpatric took up residence in India as Visiting Professor in Philosophy at Delhi University, with responsibilities for representing RF interests in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Under HSS director Joseph E. Black (1964-70), Gilpatric sought to advance research and teaching in the humanities and in the social and hard sciences. He was particularly eager to strengthen curriculum at agricultural universities and to increase and preserve library holdings. From 1968 to 1972, Gilpatric coordinated a socioeconomic study of small farmers in Uttar Pradesh state. Gilpatric returned to the United States in April 1972. The Social Sciences programs had been officially phased out in 1970 and replaced with separate Arts and Humanities divisions.",
