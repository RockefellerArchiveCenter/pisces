            "description": "This series contains the office files of George L. Hinman. They document official activities in the execution of his duties as a member of Rockefeller's staff. The actions, decisions, and exchanges of information or points of view documented here occurred in the course of proposing and implementing policies for the Rockefeller administration, political campaigns, and/or Rockefeller's personal activities. However, unless a document is personally signed by Nelson A. Rockefeller, or is referred to in a document personally signed by him, it should not be assumed he saw the document or was aware of its existence or substance. Furthermore, researchers should bear in mind that staff files may contain documents or drafts addressed to Rockefeller that were never shown to him.\n\n Issues of the \"Congressional Quarterly\" from 1962-1971 are also available. Complete yearly runs exist for 1964-1967. Some issues were annotated by Mr. Hinman.",
