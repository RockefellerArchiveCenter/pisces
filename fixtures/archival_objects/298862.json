          "content": "Following Nelson A. Rockefeller's death in January 1979, Hugh Morrow conducted interviews with Rockefeller's former associates and family members to document the memories of those people who had significant working and personal relationships with him. Between August 1979 and September 1980, Morrow interviewed 76 individuals. All but one of the interviews were tape recorded; Morrow made a transcript of the one unrecorded interview from his notes. A few interviews were summarized by Morrow, while all others were transcribed verbatim. The recording tapes were not saved.\n\nMany of the interviewees are deceased but not all. Editing was completed on several transcripts, but others have handwritten notations of correction. The folder list includes the interviewees' relevant positions, dates of interviews, and page counts.\n\nThroughout the transcripts, topics range from politics to art and from foreign policy to family relationships and philanthropy. There is a heavy emphasis on Rockefeller's three presidential and four gubernatorial campaigns from 1958 to 1970. A number of the interviews also focus on New York State government programs and administration. Additionally, in some interviews there is discussion of Latin America and the organizations and programs that Rockefeller established or enhanced for that region of the globe. The transcripts are most useful as indications of how these individuals viewed particular issues and interacted with Nelson Rockefeller and his staff or family.",
