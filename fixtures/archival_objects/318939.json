The states are then arranged numerically/alphabetically. For example, ST 1 is Alabama, ST 2 is Alaska, ST 3 is Arizona and so on.\n\nIf a folder becomes too large to hold invitations from a particular state or geographic area, it is then divided alphabetically by the name of the city. Cities represented by a significant amount of documentation will have their own folder, or multiple folders.\n\nForeign invitations are primarily filed by the year of the event/country/city.\n\n",
