Rockefeller for the purpose of eventually coauthoring a biography of Rockefeller.\n\nThe subject matter varies greatly both within and among the interviews. However, the topics most widely discussed by Rockefeller are his interests and activities related to Latin America and his insights on the state of the nation and the world during and immediately following World War II. Rockefeller also provides his detailed impressions of several of the U.S. Presidents under whom he served or against whom he campaigned: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard M. Nixon. In the final interview (Folder 12), Rockefeller reflects on his tenure as Vice President in the Ford Administration. To some extent, throughout the interviews he also discusses his family, his childhood, and significant influences on his life while he was growing up.",
