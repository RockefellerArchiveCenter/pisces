Some of the notes appear to have been made in preparation for his meeting in Saudi Arabia with Prince Fahd and Prince Abdullah of the Saudi royal family. The notes cover the points NAR wanted to make in his effort to \"sell\" the Saudis on Sarabam including his assessment of the Mid-East situation, and how a joint investment project would foster economic development and thereby promote peace, stability and prosperity and thwart the spread of communism in the region. These points were condensed and typed on a set of fourteen 5x8 inch file cards with the following titles: Peace in the Middle East; Economic Perspective; Two Families Joining Together (Rockefeller and Saud); Food and Energy; Advantages to a Joint Venture; Philosophy; Contributions of Each Side; Outline; Description of Management; and Boycott. There are also twelve pages of stenographer's notes taken at a thirty five minute meeting between NAR, Crown Prince Fahd and Prince Abdullah. The Crown Prince made no commitments.\n\n",
