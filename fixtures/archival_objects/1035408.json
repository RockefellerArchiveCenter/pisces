It also includes responses to condolences received by his wife, Margaretta (Happy) Rockefeller, that were sent in 1979 and 1980. Prior to 2019, it was closed to research due to privacy restrictions.\n\nMuch of the correspondence is routine. However, the files on the Rockefeller Brothers Fund from the 1970s document the efforts to redefine the mission of that philanthropic organization, while the real estate files on the Pocantico, New York, family estate address the planning in advance of its designation as a historic property.\n\nOf particular note are the files from the two years between Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s vice presidential tenure and his death in 1979. This constitutes copies of outgoing correspondence but includes documentation of personal projects he initiated after a lengthy career in public service. Among them was a newly launched book-publishing venture on his art and automobile collections. Also, correspondence with Douglas Dillon in 1978 describes the transfer of the collections of Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s Museum of Primitive Art in New York to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",
