Rockefeller's governorship. The actions, decisions, and exchanges of information or points of view documented here occurred in the course of proposing and implementing policies for the Rockefeller administration. However, unless a document is personally signed by Nelson A. Rockefeller, or is referred to in a document personally signed by him, it should not be assumed that he saw the document or was aware of its existence or substance. Furthermore, researchers should bear in mind that these files may contain documents addressed to Rockefeller which were never shown to him.\n\nSCOPE AND CONTENT\n\nThis series consists of periodic reports prepared by departments and agencies of the New York state government for Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. The reports are of four different types, from four different periods representing each of Governor Rockefeller's four administrations. In general the reports offer an assessment of each department's responsibilities, goals, performance, problems, and needs. Each of the four different report types is found for most, but not all, of the departments. The four types of reports are as follows:\n\nProgram Meeting Report, 1960. Issued in late 1960, these were the result of meetings by representatives of each department with the Secretary to the Governor and the Counsel to the Governor. The purpose of the meeting was to identify the major issues each department would face in the coming year and to define any legislative and budgetary support necessary to meet the issues.\n\nQuarterly Reports, 1963-1966. These were initiated by Governor Rockefeller in March 1963 in response to a fiscal crisis and a \"taxpayer revolt\" which affected the operation of all departments and construction programs. The reports were to include a one-page \"Commissioner's statement,\" the status of major programs, emergency situations and other unusual developments, and brief summaries of recent research, publications, and management improvement plans. Many of the reports include charts, tables, other graphics, and appendices of departmental publications. The reports were submitted to Dr. William J. Ronan, Secretary to the Governor. Dr. Ronan's staff of Program Associates reviewed the reports and wrote one-page summaries highlighting the most important points and sometimes offering comments on the quality of the report. Copies of the reports, summaries, and a cover letter from Dr. Ronan were then forwarded to Governor Rockefeller, Lt. Gov. Malcolm Wilson, Budget Director Dr. T. Norman Hurd, and Counsel to the Governor Sol Neil Corbin (later Robert R. Douglass). Governor Rockefeller's handwritten comments are found on a few of these reports. The reports begin with the first quarter of 1963. Most agencies reported through the first quarter of 1966. The reason for terminating the reports is not found in this series. Further information on the guidelines for these reports can be found in folder 102, \"Reporting Format.\"\n\nAgency Appraisal Reports, 1970. These reports represent a self-analysis by each agency defining the agency's purpose, the status of its current programs, and its future plans and needs. They are similar to the Program Meeting Reports, but with more depth. The Appraisal Reports were compiled in the summer of 1970 and together they form a detailed snapshot of the executive branch of the New York state government.\n\nMonthly Reports, 1971-1973. Actually issued every four weeks, these reports are short narratives written in memo form by each agency head. The average length is three pages, with no graphics and few appendices. The focus is on immediate issues and activities. The reports were sent to T. Norman Hurd (Director of State Operations, January 1, 1971-August 31, 1972, Secretary to the Governor, September 1, 1972-1975) who reviewed them and identified a few key points from each report in a summary to Governor Rockefeller. Up to a dozen reports were sent to Governor Rockefeller at a time with a one page summary covering all the reports. Points highlighted in the summary were keyed to numbered tabs attached to the reports. These summaries are filed separately in folders 105-107, \"Forwarding Memos and Summaries.\" Many of the summaries bear Governor Rockefeller's handwritten comments. These reports began in March 1971 and the last ones are dated late November or early December 1973, just before Governor Rockefeller's resignation on December 18.", "publish": true}], "publish": true}, {"jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "1e508726dd6cb9470d8e8fd140f1681f", "label": "Processing Information note", "type": "processinfo", "subnotes": [{"jsonmodel_type": "note_text", "content": "Harold W.
