Guy S. Hayes, an Assistant Director in the Medical and Natural Sciences division, held the post of Field Director in Cali from 1960 until 1970. After 1970, the office was headed by Foundation Representatives Patrick N. Owens (1970-1974) and Farzam Arbab (1974-78). The office closed on December 31, 1983.\n\nRF activity in Colombia reflected the broad reorientation of Foundation programming away from Europe and towards the developing world which took place under RF Presidents Dean Rusk (1952-1961) and J. George Harrar (1961-1972). In Latin America, as in Africa and Southeast Asia, the Foundation sought to relieve basic human needs by establishing rural and community development programs, strengthening disease research facilities, and revitalizing universities that they might become more responsive to local populations. The RF approach to development involved the training of local personnel and the strengthening of local institutions through exchange programs with American universities and fellowships support for Colombian scholars.\n\nOne of the prime beneficiaries of RF support in Colombia was the Universidad del Valle and its Medical School at Cali, which received assistance under the RF's University Development program (1963-1978). (The program was renamed Education for Development (EFD) in 1974). The Universidad del Valle became one of the best medical schools in Latin America, combining the practice of public health at the Candelaria Rural Health Center with the teaching and practice of medicine. The EFD program was phased out in 1978, with future university grants made within the appropriate RF program areas.", "publish": true}], "publish": true}, {"jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "14510d68974c5407bfd2244b2f6e19a4", "label": "Arrangement note", "type": "arrangement", "subnotes": [{"jsonmodel_type": "note_text", "content": "The Cali office records are arranged in four series:\n\nSeries 1 - Administrative Correspondence;\nSeries 2 - Universidad del Valle--Academic Programs;\nSeries 3 - Universidad del Valle--Medical Programs;\nSeries 4 - Cooperating Universities and Programs.\n\nWithin series, files are arranged in the order received, according to an internal numeric system. Retaining the files' original order preserves the usefulness of numerous cross-reference inserts that refer to related files by number. Gaps in the numbering sequence indicate that the office discarded portions of these records prior to their transfer to New York in 1977, 1978, and 1984.\n\nFolders are arranged by file number.

Series I contains eight folders concerning the Cali field station of the RF's Virus Research Program (1964-73), a program for research on arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses. The bulk of the collection, located in Series II and III, relates to the development of the University del Valle's Academic and library programs and its medical school under the auspices of the RF's University Development (1963-74) and Education For Development (1974-78) programs. Series IV includes correspondence between the Cali staff and several American universities cooperating with the Universidad del Valle in rural and tropical disease research, preventitive medicine and nutrition, and child and public health.\n\nCorrespondents include Farzam Arbab, Ulysses J.
