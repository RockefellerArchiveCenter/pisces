Rockefeller's tenure (December 19, 1974, to January 20, 1977). The series offers partial documentation of Rockefeller's role in the development of national policy and his duties as President of the U.S. Senate. There is correspondence with President Gerald R. Ford and members of his staff, congressional representatives, senators, other government officials, and foreign dignitaries. However, there is very little in this series documenting actual policy formation. Much of the correspondence with government officials concerns the Vice President's information-gathering activities on behalf of the White House and executive agencies, as well as his support of the President's policies. There are also reports and position papers on national issues submitted to the Vice President by individuals both within and outside the federal government. Virtually all of these were unsolicited.\n\nAlso documented here are Rockefeller's campaign activities on behalf of President Ford and Senator Robert Dole in the 1976 presidential campaign.\n\nThe bulk of the correspondence consists of letters from U.S. citizens expressing their opinions on issues, inviting the Vice President to speak at events, asking for autographed photographs of the Vice President, or asking for the his assistance in securing an appointment to a federal agency or a military academy. The responses to such correspondence were written by the Vice President's staff.\n\nCarbon copies of outgoing correspondence are filed in the name, subject, and chronological files. Routine incoming correspondence is filed in the name file, while incoming correspondence of significance was photocopied and filed in both the name and subject files. The chronological file contains only outgoing letters.", "publish": true}], "publish": true}, {"jsonmodel_type": "note_singlepart", "persistent_id": "91aeba3704277569c9afb39744899971", "label": "General Physical Description note", "type": "physdesc", "content": ["206 standard records cartons -- Boxes 15, 18-23, 25-61, 68-215, 218-224."], "publish": true}], "uri": "/repositories/2/resources/577", "repository": {"ref": "/repositories/2"}, "collection_management": {"lock_version": 0, "rights_determined": false, "created_by": "battalb", "last_modified_by": "battalb", "create_time": "2016-10-22T19:18:18Z", "system_mtime": "2017-06-02T20:50:51Z", "user_mtime": "2016-10-22T19:18:18Z", "processing_status": "completed", "jsonmodel_type": "collection_management", "external_ids": [], "uri": "/repositories/2/collection_management/3864", "repository": {"ref": "/repositories/2"}, "parent": {"ref": "/repositories/2/resources/577"}}, "user_defined": {"lock_version": 0, "boolean_1": false, "boolean_2": false, "boolean_3": false, "date_2": "2007-12-31", "created_by": "battalb", "last_modified_by": "battalb", "create_time": "2016-10-22T19:18:18Z", "system_mtime": "2016-10-22T19:18:18Z", "user_mtime": "2016-10-22T19:18:18Z", "enum_1": "2 - Minimal", "jsonmodel_type": "user_defined", "repository": {"ref": "/repositories/2"}}, "tree": {"ref": "/repositories/2/resources/577/tree"}}
